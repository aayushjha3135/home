<p><h3>Blogging is story-telling. A good blog design becomes a part of the stories you tell.
 A simple, austere tech blog can communicate seriousness and clarity.<br> A whimsical, cartoonish
 parenting blog suggests fun and relatability.</p></h3>
<h4>Starting a blog for the first time is an amazing, yet intimidating experience.
<br>
Thinking that people are actually going to read – and even share – something you wrote. It’s unlike any other feeling I can describe.
<br>
But it’s not all rainbows and butterflies. Starting a blog is hard work, and there are a lot of pitfalls along the way. Especially if you’re a newbie.
